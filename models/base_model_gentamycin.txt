DESCRIPTION:
The administration is via an infusion (requires INFUSION RATE or INFUSION DURATION column-type in the data set).
The PK model has one compartment (volume V) and a linear elimination (clearance Cl).
[COVARIATE]
input = {weight, age}

EQUATION:
t_weight = log(weight/7.1)
coeff_weight= 0.743
t_age = log(age/20.7)
coeff_age= 0.321

input={V_pop, omega_V, Cl_pop, omega_Cl, weight, t_weight, coeff_weight, t_age, coeff_age}

DEFINITION:
V = {distribution=lognormal, typical=V_pop, covariate=t_weight, coefficient = coeff_weight, sd=omega_V}
Cl = {distribution=lognormal, typical=Cl_pop, covariate=t_age, coefficient = coeff_age, sd=omega_Cl}
